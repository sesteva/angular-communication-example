=============================

This is a basic protoype illustrating how we can get rid of controllers. 

Instead have our independent components/directives fetch the data. 

When we do that a few problems come to my mind. 

- What about multiple components fetching the same data? 
- What about getting fresh data on deman?

Those are the kind of questions we attempt to answer on this example
